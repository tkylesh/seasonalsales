# Seasonal Sales

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/seasonal-sales && cd $_
touch index.html
touch seasonal-sales.js
```

## Instructions

You work as a developer for a big box store. Here is a JSON representation of a small sample of the products you sell.

```js
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "Kids socks",
      "price": 4.99,
      "category_id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mens socks",
      "price": 6.99,
      "category_id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Ladies socks",
      "price": 7.99,
      "category_id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Foot stool",
      "price": 14.99,
      "category_id": 2
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Lava lamp",
      "price": 9.99,
      "category_id": 2
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "3 drawer dresser",
      "price": 64.99,
      "category_id": 2
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "Air filter",
      "price": 6.99,
      "category_id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "name": "Surge protector",
      "price": 8.99,
      "category_id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "name": "Plastic storage bin",
      "price": 3.99,
      "category_id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "name": "Light bulb",
      "price": 1.99,
      "category_id": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is a JSON representation of some of the departments in your stores.

```js
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Apparel",
      "season_discount": "Winter",
      "discount": 0.10
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Furniture",
      "season_discount": "Autumn",
      "discount": 0.25
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Household",
      "season_discount": "Spring",
      "discount": 0.15
    }
  ]
}
```

Your job is to build a web page that lists all of the products, the name of the department it's in, and the price. Additionally, put a `<select>` element at the top of the page that contains all possible values of the `season_discount` key in the categories file. As soon as you select one of the seasons, all prices on the page should immediately be discounted by the corresponding percentage.

For example, when _Spring_ is chosen, all products in the corresponding Household category should have their prices updated with a 15% discount off the base price.

The two JSON representations above should be in two files: `products.json`, and `categories.json`. You should load both file via XHRs and store the contents in two different JavaScript variables in your code.
